        Safety Control is a mobile app that detects use of personal protective equipment by staff before they start working with equipment. It also informs in case of presence in a dangerous zone.  

Safety Control product is based on artificial intelligence technology for analyzing data from video. This helps to detect people and objects at the production site.

When a worker approaches the machine, AI technology detects whether this person is wearing personal protective equipment or not. If not, Safety Control app sends a warning requiring you to wear a protective helmet.

At the same time, Safety Control app takes a photo of the person who neglects safety protocols. The image is saved in Safety Control Odoo, where managers can observe those who violate safety rules and contact them directly.
